# L.F.G.-Looking-For-Gamenight--Group-Project-V2
Coding Dojo "Group Project" Overhauled by DeShawn Thomas and DeShawn Thomas alone...

I took the group project from what we presented to pass the class and added more functionality to it.

Planning to add search functionality and rating system to it at a later time.

## Description 
Introducing "Looking for Gamenight" (L.F.G.), a collaborative group project from my time at Coding Dojo. L.F.G. is a Python-based application built with the Flask framework, designed to bring gamers together in their local areas for hosting or attending exciting game nights.

In this project, I assumed a leadership role, actively contributing to the team's success and guiding our collective efforts. Together, we coordinated the development of L.F.G., focusing on creating a user-friendly platform that facilitates connections between gamers in the same vicinity.

Through L.F.G., users can discover and join local game nights, fostering a vibrant gaming community. Whether it's board games, video games, or any other gaming format, L.F.G. acts as a hub for organizing and participating in these gatherings.

In addition to the core functionality, we inhave plans on integrating a user rating system, enabling participants to provide feedback and establish a trustworthy community of gaming enthusiasts. This feature enhances the overall experience and encourages positive interactions among users.

By leveraging the power of Python and the flexibility of the Flask framework, we successfully developed a robust platform that simplifies the process of finding and joining game nights in the local area. We are excited to share this project and contribute to building stronger gaming communities around the world.

## Why did I make this app? 
As a newcomer to Atlanta, I missed the game nights I used to enjoy back home in Tennessee. Being in my late 20s, I sought a way to make new friends with similar interests. This led me to create 'Looking for Gamenight' (L.F.G.), a platform that connects gamers in Atlanta and facilitates game nights.

L.F.G. emerged from my personal need to recreate the camaraderie and fun I experienced during game nights in Tennessee. I wanted to build a community where late 20s gamers like myself could come together, host game nights, and form new friendships.

With L.F.G., I collaborated with a dedicated team to develop an intuitive app that simplifies finding and attending game nights. When we incorporate a user rating system, we ensure a positive and welcoming environment for participants.

Using Python and the Flask framework, we successfully created L.F.G. to fulfill my personal need and help others in similar situations. I'm excited to share this app with gamers in Atlanta and beyond, fostering new friendships, unforgettable game nights, and a thriving community of late 20s gamers. Let's connect and let the games begin!
